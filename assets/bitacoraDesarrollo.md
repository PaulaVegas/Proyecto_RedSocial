## 🧪 Testing

### Testing with jest:
Started testing with jest, had to create app.js and separate code from index.js so as to separate the logic from the express server (the .listen) and to be able to reuse my app in testing without initializing the real server.
Installed the `mongodb-memory-server` library to have a temporary MongoDB database.
